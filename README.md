# TypeScript examples

Learning TypeScript through simple examples.

## Commands

- `yarn start` to build the sources in watch mode
- `yarn build` to build the sources once
- `yarn lint` to run the linter

Just run `yarn start` to start the build in watch mode and then run `node build/10-array-destructuring` etc to run the examples.
